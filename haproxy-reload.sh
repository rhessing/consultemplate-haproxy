# A script to help with haproxy reloads. Needs sudo if haproxy uses :80 / :443.
#
# ./haproxy-reload.sh <strategy> <cfg> [<need-state>]
#
# <strategy>: `native`
#    Uses native HAProxy soft restart. Running it for the first time starts
#    HAProxy, each subsequent invocation will perform a soft-reload.
# <strategy>: `reusesocket` or any other string != `native`
#    Pass the listening sockets to the new HAProxy process instead of
#    rebinding them, allowing hitless reloads.
#
# <cfg>: configuration file or directory
#
# <need-state>: optional, defaults to `false`, anything != 0 means `true`
#
# HAProxy options:
#  -f config file
#  -p pid file
#  -D run as daemon
#  -sf soft reload, wait for pids to finish handling requests
#      send pids a resume signal if reload of new config fails
#  -x get the listening sockets from the old HAProxy process
#
